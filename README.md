A massive simulation for assessing hybrid control methods (existing and their variation) in early phase trials

This repository contains the simulation R and jags code for evaluating hybrid control methods in early phase trials. Both binary and survival outcomes are being evaluated. Six Frequnetist and eight Bayesian methods were being considered. In the simulation, we assumed two historical trilas being borrowed.
